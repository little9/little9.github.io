    I'm the digital preservation and application development librarian at the <a href="http://library.miami.edu">University of Miami Libraries.</a></p>

  <p>
    My research interests include digital preservation, markup languages, and software design.</p>

    Some open source projects that I have worked on include UM's <a href="https://github.com/UMiamiLibraries/aptrust-automation">APTrust Automation software</a>, <a href="http://library.miami.edu/udvd">UDVD</a> a customized Blacklight interface for browsing videos, and <a href="https://github.com/UMiamiLibraries/RAMP">RAMP</a> a tool for enhancing finding aids and publishing them on Wikipedia.</p>
  <p>I also contribute to <a href="http://github.com/SubjectsPlus/subjectsplus">SubjectsPlus</a> a tool for creating subject guides for libraries that can also be used as a library focused CMS.</p>

  <p>Hi, I'm Jamie.</p>
  <p>
    I'm a software developer in Kansas City who works at <a href="https://kicksite.com">Kicksite</a>.
  </p>
  <p>I mostly code in Ruby and JavaScript, but have used Python, Java, and PHP in professional contexts before.
  </p>
  <p>I worked at <a href="https://curationexperts.com">Data Curation Experts</a> before starting at Kicksite. During that time, I worked on projects for <a
      href="https://github.com/curationexperts/laevigata">Emory University</a>, <a href="https://github.com/curationexperts/epigaea">Tufts</a>,

    <p>Earlier, I was the digital preservation and software development librarian at the University of Miami.</p>
    <p>Before that, I was a GA at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign where I wrote and maintained software for the
      iSchool Research Services department and contributed development work to research projects.</p>

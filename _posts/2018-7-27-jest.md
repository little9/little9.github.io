title: "Finally! Easy JS testing in Rails with Jest"
author: Jamie Little

Rails 5.1 introduced support for modern JavaScript development workflows. Now your Rails projects can take advantage of the wider JS ecosystem. 
One of the benefits that brings is an easier way of doing unit testing for the JS in your Rails project. 

Testing JS in Rails was possible before, but becomes complicated if you want to use 
ES6 and modules. One of the projects that I work on created the infrastructure to 
<a href="https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/tree/master/spec/javascripts">test ES6 with Jasmine</a>, but it's kind of complicated. 

The following is how you would set up basic testing with <a href="https://jestjs.io/">jest</a> and ES6. 

Now you can setup a new Rails project with `webpacker` (or add the `webpacker` Gem to an existing project):

```bash
rails new --webpacker
```

Then use `yarn` to to add jest to your development 
dependencies:  

```sh
yarn add --dev jest
```

Since we want to use ES6 for our JS, we'll need to install 
babel and babel-jest:

```sh
yarn add --dev babel-preset-env
yarn add --dev babel-jest
``` 

Make a folder to store your tests:

```sh 
mkdir app/javascript/tests
```

In the `package.json` at the root of your project you
do need to add a bit of setup so that `jest` knows where to find your tests.

```json
{
  "name": "myapp",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "@rails/webpacker": "3.5"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "babel-jest": "^23.4.2",
    "jest": "^23.4.2",
    "webpack-dev-server": "2.11.2"
  },
  "jest": {
    "roots": [
      "<rootDir>/app/javascript/tests"
    ],
    "verbose": true,
    "testURL": "http://localhost",
    "moduleFileExtensions": [
      "js",
      "json",
      "vue"
    ],
    "moduleDirectories": [
      "node_modules",
      "<rootDir>/app/javascript"
    ],
    "moduleNameMapper": {
      "^@/(.*)$": "<rootDir>/$1"
    },
    "transform": {
      "^.+\\.js$": "<rootDir>/node_modules/babel-jest"
    }
  }, 
   "scripts": {
    "test": "jest --config package.json"
  }
}
```

In `.babelrc`:
```json
{
  "presets": [
    ["env", {
      "modules": false,
      "targets": {
        "browsers": "> 1%",
        "uglify": true
      },
      "useBuiltIns": true
    }]
  ],
  "plugins": [
    "syntax-dynamic-import",
    "transform-object-rest-spread",
    ["transform-class-properties", { "spec": true }],
  ],
  "env": {
    "test": {
      "presets": [
        ["env", { "targets": { "node": "current" }}]
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

You can write your test and the implementation after this initial setup. Simply
import your class in the test and create the class in `../libs/`.

```js
import HtmlStripper from '../libs/HtmlStripper'

test('strips html tags from a string', () => {
  const htmlStripper = new HtmlStripper({
    html: '<p>test</p>'
  })
  expect(htmlStripper.stripHtml()).toEqual('test')
})
```

```js
export default class HtmlStripper {
  constructor (options) {
    this.html = options.html
  }

  stripHtml () {
    const doc = new DOMParser().parseFromString(this.html, 'text/html')
    return doc.body.textContent || ''
  }
}
```

Then run `yarn test`. Your test should pass, and you can even run `yarn test --coverage`
to get coverage information or `yarn test --watch` to run your tests continuously in the
background. 

You'll notice that this class uses `DOMParser` which is provided by the browser. This
